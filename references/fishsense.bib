abstract = {Publisher Summary
Photogrammetry comprises all techniques concerned with making measurements of real-world objects and terrain features from images. These may be aerial as well as terrestrial images, and they may be taken by film cameras, digital cameras or electronic scanners on tripods, airborne or spaceborne platforms. Applications include the measuring of coordinates, quantification of distances, heights, areas and volumes, preparation of topographic maps, and generation of digital elevation models and orthophotographs. Understanding the geometry of a single photograph is the basis for all measurement techniques. A number of simple equations may be used for deriving measurements from single vertical photographs taken over flat terrain. However, they do not apply without restriction for oblique imagery or varying relief. Both cause image scale to vary across the scene, and undulating terrain results in radial relief displacement of features rising above or dipping below the horizontal plane at the image center.}

  abstract  = {Robust recovery of lost colors in underwater images re-
mains a challenging problem. We recently showed that
this was partly due to the prevalent use of an atmospheric
image formation model for underwater images and pro-
posed a physically accurate model. The revised model
showed: 1) the attenuation coefficient of the signal is not
uniform across the scene but depends on object range and
reflectance, 2) the coefficient governing the increase in
backscatter with distance differs from the signal attenua-
tion coefficient. Here, we present the first method that re-
covers color with our revised model, using RGBD images.
The Sea-thru method estimates backscatter using the dark
pixels and their known range information. Then, it uses
an estimate of the spatially varying illuminant to obtain
the range-dependent attenuation coefficient. Using more
than 1,100 images from two optically different water bod-
ies, which we make available, we show that our method with
the revised model outperforms those using the atmospheric
model. Consistent removal of water will open up large un-
derwater datasets to powerful computer vision and machine
learning algorithms, creating exciting opportunities for the
future of underwater exploration and conservation.},

In the past years estimation of depth from monocular images have shown great improvement, however, in the underwater environment results are still lagging behind due to appearance changes caused by the medium. So far little effort has been invested on overcoming this. Moreover, underwater, there are more limitations for using high resolution depth sensors, this makes generating ground truth for learning methods another enormous obstacle. So far unsupervised methods that tried to solve this have achieved very limited success as they relied on domain transfer from dataset in air. We suggest training using subsequent frames self-supervised by a reprojection loss, as was demonstrated successfully above water. We suggest several additions to the self-supervised framework to cope with the underwater environment and achieve state-of-the-art results on a challenging forward-looking underwater dataset.},

Participation rates declined with population density and gross domestic product, indicating a negative effect of urbanisation and post-modernisation on fishing interest. Participation rates also declined with increasing median age, average household size and unemployment rate, suggesting resource limitation to constrain participation in fishing. By contrast, two indicators of the cultural importance of fish (fish landings and per capita fish consumption) and an indicator of perceived need for leisure (weekly working hours) were positively correlated with fishing participation. Based on these findings, which explained 60\% of the variance in fishing participation across the industrialised world, reduced fishing interest is to be expected with post-industrialisation. Dedicated management and marketing intervention is needed to reverse the track of diminishing fishing interest in industrialised countries.},

	abstract     = {Abstract Investigating sexual dimorphism is important for our understanding of its influence on reproductive strategies including maleâmale competition, mate choice, and sexual conflict. Measuring physical traits in wild animals can be logistically challenging and disruptive for the animals. Therefore body size and ornament variation in wild primates have rarely been quantified. Gorillas are amongst the most sexually dimorphic and dichromatic primates. Adult males (silverbacks) possess a prominent sagittal crest, a pad of fibrous and fatty tissue on top of the head, have red crest coloration, their saddle appears silver, and they possess a silverline along their stomach. Here we measure levels of sexual dimorphism and within-male variation of body length, head size, and sexual dichromatism in a population of wild western gorillas using photogrammetry. Digital photogrammetry is a useful and precise method to measure sexual dimorphism in physical traits yielding sexual dimorphism indices (ISD), similar to those derived from traditional measurements of skeletal remains. Silverbacks were on an average 1.23 times longer in body length than adult females. Sexual dimorphism of head size was highest in measures of crest size (max ISD: 60.4) compared with measures of facial height (max ISD: 24.7). The most sexually dimorphic head size measures also showed the highest within-sex variation. We found no clear sex differences in crest coloration but there was large sexual dichromatism with high within-male variation in saddle coloration and silverline size. Further studies should examine if these sexually dimorphic traits are honest signals of competitive ability and confer an advantage in reproductive success. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2007.

The basic hypothesis is that the estimate of the illuminant is made on the basis of spatial information from the entire visual field. This estimate is then used by the visual system to arrive at an estimate of the (object) reflectance of the various subfields in the complex visual scene. The estimates are made by matching the inputs to the system to linear combinations of fixed bases and standards in the colour space.

We evaluated length measurement error (herein, referred to as “error”) and digit preference from fish studies conducted on the Colorado River and Little Colorado River in Arizona. Empirical error estimates varied among fish species and generally increased with fish size. We identified a digit preference for numbers ending in zero and five, which was exacerbated with larger sizes. Error effects on growth estimates were largest for fish recaptured after a short time, and we suggest guarding against the error phenomenon by removing data from fish captured and recaptured within a minimum of 30 days. Human, situation, and specimen induced error factors are described. Fisheries professionals should be cognizant of error factors, especially in situations when high precision and accuracy are required and results have important management implications.RESUMENun aspecto fundamental en las ciencias pesqueras es la medición de la talla corporal. Los humanos somos inherentemente propensos a cometer errores pese a los sistemas y medidas preventivas que se utilizan para reducirlos. En este trabajo se evalúa el error asociado a la medición de la talla (en lo sucesivo se le llamará “error”) y la preferencia en el número de dígitos en los estudios ícticos llevados a cabo en el Río Colorado y el Río Coloradito, Arizona. Los estimados empíricos del error variaron entre especies de peces y en general se incrementaron conforme la aumenta la talla de los peces. Se identificaron preferencias en cuanto al número de dígitos para los números con terminación cero y cinco, lo cual se amplificó en los peces más grandes. Los efectos del error en las estimaciones de crecimiento fueron más grandes en el caso de los peces recién recapturados. Se sugiere tratar el fenómeno del error mediante la remoción de los datos provenientes de peces recapturados en los primeros 30 días después de su liberación. Se describen los factores de error humano, de medición y asociado al espécimen. Los profesionales de las pesquerías deben ser conscientes de los factores de error, especialmente en situaciones en las que se requieren precisión y exactitud y cuando hay implicaciones importantes para el manejo.},

Although comparability of data may promote improved assessment of fish populations, and thus management of often critically important nearshore fisheries, to date no standardized and agreed-upon survey method has emerged. This study describes the use of methods across the research community and identifies potential drivers of method selection. An online survey was distributed to researchers from academic, governmental, and non-governmental organizations internationally. Although many methods were identified, 89% of survey-based projects employed one of three methods - belt transect, stationary point count, and some variation of the timed swim method. The selection of survey method was independent of the research design (i.e., assessment goal) and region of study, but was related to the researchers home institution. While some researchers expressed willingness to modify their current survey protocols to more standardized protocols (76%), their willingness decreased when methodologies were tied to long-term datasets spanning five or more years. Willingness to modify current methodologies was also less common among academic researchers than resource managers. By understanding both the current application of methods and the reported motivations for method selection, we hope to focus discussions towards increasing the comparability of quantitative reef fish survey data.},

abstract = {Measurements of fish lengths are a basic requirement of most fisheries monitoring programmes globally, however traditional methods for collection of this data entails inherent inefficiencies and errors. Electronic devices for measuring fish and shellfish have been developed commercially, but for many organisations the cost of these devices is prohibitive. Low cost “build your own” devices have also been described, but construction of these requires considerable knowledge of electronics. Here, a design is presented for a USB electronic fish measuring board that can be assembled at low cost from “off the shelf” materials. This board was assembled using a set of skills that would be available in most research organisations. The design uses noncontact sensors activated by placing a magnet on the measurement board, which is easy to waterproof. The device is connected to a tablet computer, where a VB.NET programme records and validates the data. A running total of the estimated weight of the sample is provided, based on length-weight relationships. Length frequencies collected by both a conventional measuring board and this electronic board from the same commercial catches for 6 fish species showed no significant differences. The design described here allows the construction of a low cost unit which simultaneously improves both efficiency and accuracy of fish length data collection with minimal electronic construction skills.}

Scuba diving is an expanding industry, and several examples illustrate how the diving sector has assisted with transitions to sustainable economic activities. In certain countries diving tourism generates revenues comparable with fishing industries, yet the sector remains underrepresented within marine conservation efforts. Therefore, we present five actions tailored to enhance the diving sector’s participation in the Blue Economy: i) Organize the fragmented sector via international associations and federations; ii) Recognize usage rights for natural capital equal to extractive activities; iii) Modernize the sector using technology to improve connectivity and data sharing; iv) Invest in the sector by engaging private and public funding and subsidizing critical infrastructure to enable equitable access; v) Foster a sense of community by training and supporting local leaders, thereby ensuring more equitable participation by including women, indigenous people, and the youth. Diving represents one of the only endeavors that enables citizens to actively support the Blue Economy and help to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14, “Life Below Water”; therefore, the diving sector is uniquely poised to help address conservation goals and sustainable development.},

	abstract     = {Abstract There has been rapid uptake of stereo-video-based sampling techniques to collect species, abundance and body-size information on fish assemblages and their associated habitats. Stereo-video methods provide highly accurate estimates of body-size, range and sampling area as well as a permanent record that can be cross-checked or resampled for additional data. Due to these advantages, diver-operated stereo-video (stereo-DOV) is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to underwater visual census. We provide a comprehensive guide for researchers using stereo-DOVs to survey fish assemblages and their associated habitat. Information on stereo-DOV design, video camera settings, field operations and video analysis are outlined. StereoâDOV surveys permit rapid and simultaneous collection of data on fish diversity, abundance, length and behaviour as well as their associated habitat. However, biases associated with diver presence in the water and variation in detectability should be considered and are dependent on the location and focal species of the survey. We recommend using stereo-DOVs for diver-based surveys of non-cryptic fish assemblages, given the advantages described. An increased uptake of this methodology, following the standard procedures described herein, will reduce variation in methodology, assist in the synthesis of data on continental and global scales and provide accurate information to improve fisheries management and conservation.},

    abstract = {Videogrammetry and photogrammetry are increasingly being used in marine science for unsupervised data collection. The camera systems employed are complex, in contrast to “consumer” digital cameras and smartphones carried by potential citizen scientists. However, using consumer cameras in photogrammetry will introduce unknown length estimation errors through both the image acquisition process and lens distortion. This study presents a methodology to achieve accurate 2-dimensional (2-D) total length (TL) estimates of fish without specialist equipment or proprietary software. Photographs of fish were captured with an action camera using a background fiducial marker, a foreground fiducial marker and a laser marker. The geometric properties of the lens were modelled with OpenCV to correct image distortion. TL estimates were corrected for parallax effects using an algorithm requiring only the initial length estimate and known fish morphometric relationships. Correcting image distortion decreased RMSE by 96\% and the percentage mean bias error (\%MBE) by 50\%. Correcting for parallax effects achieved a \%MBE of −0.6\%. This study demonstrates that the morphometric measurement of different species can be accurately estimated without the need for complex camera equipment, making it particularly suitable for deployment in citizen science and other volunteer-based data collection endeavours.},

Data from more than 230 populations reveal a median reduction of 83\\% in breeding population size from known historic levels. Few populations recover rapidly; most exhibit little or no change in abundance up to 15 years after a collapse. Reductions in fishing pressure, although clearly necessary for population recovery, are often insufficient. Persistence and recovery are also influenced by life history, habitat alteration, changes to species assemblages, genetic responses to exploitation, and reductions in population growth attributable to the Allee effect, also known as depensation. Heightened extinction risks were highlighted recently when a Canadian population of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) was listed as endangered, on the basis of declines as high as 99.9\\% over 30 years. Unprecedented reductions in abundance and surprisingly low rates of recovery draw attention to scientists' limited understanding of how fish behavior, habitat, ecology, and evolution affect population growth at low abundance. Failure to prevent population collapses, and to take the conservation biology of marine fishes seriously, will ensure that many severely depleted species remain ecological and numerical shadows in the ecosystems that they once dominated.}},

	abstract     = {Abstract Knowledge of whale length is important to ecological studies. However, photographic techniques to measure sperm whales traditionally require high vantage points or a complicated stereo system. Furthermore, these traditional techniques require an alongside approach that often prevents individual identification. For simple and fast size measurements at sea, I used a laser range finder alongside a digital camera to obtain distance to the fluke at the same time as photo-identification. The camera/lens and laser range finder were calibrated on objects of known lengths. The coefficient of variation (CV) for test objects was low (CV = 0.21\%). Forty-seven individually identified sperm whales were measured repetitively on up to 12 different occasions, and the CV was lower (CV = 1.3\%) than for other photogrammetric techniques (CV = 4.4\%â5.1\%). A regression of log fluke span to log total length from whaling and stranding data yielded an râ2 of 0.87 (CV of residuals = 6.7\%). Thirty-eight female/immature sperm whales were measured in the Gulf of Mexico (median = 9.3 m, range = 7.1â12.3 m), 167 in the Gulf of California (median = 10.7 m, range = 8.4â13.1 m) and 13 bachelor males off Kaikoura, New Zealand (median = 14.2, range = 11.7â15.8 m). The results were within known sperm whale size and suggested that the population in the Gulf of Mexico was made up of smaller animals than that of the Gulf of California. This technique is easy to implement and allows the measurement of identified individuals.},

These include growing concerns about the environmental impacts of fisheries, the role of ecological interactions in determining population dynamics, and the incorporation of uncertainty and precautionary principles into management advice. The book draws upon examples from tropical, temperate and polar environments, and provides readers with a broad understanding of the biological, economic and social aspects of fisheries ecology and the interplay between them. As well as covering 'classical' fisheries science, the book focuses on contemporary issues such as industrial fishing, poverty and conflict in fishing communities, marine reserves, the effects of fishing on coral reefs and by-catches of mammals, seabirds and reptiles. The book is primarily written for students of fisheries science and marine ecology, but should also appeal to practising fisheries scientists and those interested in conservation and the impacts of humans on the marine environment."--BOOK JACKET.},

		In the last few years, there has been a drastic improvement in the development of sensor technology that increases spatial resolution, dynamic range, and low-light sensitivity of digital cameras. Although the image processing techniques in a digital camera processing pipeline have been well studied, they face many difficulties in processing raw data of high resolution as well as raw data captured in the low light environment.

		The key to maximizing the quality of the final output images is to understand the captured raw sensor data in the proper context of a camera processing pipeline. In this dissertation, we analyze the image acquisition model and develop new image processing techniques that leverage the acquisition model. This work advances computer vision and data communication by focusing on the role that the camera processing pipeline plays. Particularly, we discuss image enhancement in low-light condition and image compression problems in the context of the image pipeline.

		To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study connecting image enhancement and compression algorithms to the context of an actual image acquisition process. Most prior image enhancement and image compression for raw sensor data used images already processed by camera processing pipelines for experimental verification while we verify the proposed image processing technique using actual sensor data.

Technological progress regarding video cameras, sensors (such as sounders), battery life and information storage make these techniques now accessible to a majority of users. However, diver-based underwater visual censuses, and catch and effort data, remain the most commonly used for observing coastal biodiversity and species. In this paper, we review the underwater video techniques that have been developed since the 1950s to investigate and/or monitor coastal biodiversity. Techniques such as remote underwater video, whether baited or not, diver-operated video and towed video are described, along with corresponding applications in the field. We then analyse the complementary of techniques, first from studies comparing video techniques with other observation techniques, whether video-based or not, and second by documenting their respective cost efficiencies. These findings are discussed with respect to current challenges in monitoring and investigating coastal biodiversity. Video should be more often considered and used, either in addition to or as an alternative to diver-based, fishing and acoustic techniques, as it may be particularly suited for monitoring coastal biodiversity in a variety of areas and on larger scales than hitherto and within an ecosystem-based approach to management and conservation.},

The camera systems employed are complex, in contrast to “consumer” digital cameras and smartphones carried by potential citizen scientists. However, using consumer cameras in photogrammetry will introduce unknown length estimation errors through both the image acquisition process and lens distortion. This study presents a methodology to achieve accurate 2-dimensional (2-D) total length (TL) estimates of fish without specialist equipment or proprietary software. Photographs of fish were captured with an action camera using a background fiducial marker, a foreground fiducial marker and a laser marker. The geometric properties of the lens were modelled with OpenCV to correct image distortion. TL estimates were corrected for parallax effects using an algorithm requiring only the initial length estimate and known fish morphometric relationships. Correcting image distortion decreased RMSE by 96\\% and the percentage mean bias error (\\%MBE) by 50\\%. Correcting for parallax effects achieved a \\%MBE of −0.6\\%. This study demonstrates that the morphometric measurement of different species can be accurately estimated without the need for complex camera equipment, making it particularly suitable for deployment in citizen science and other volunteer-based data collection endeavours.}},

Even with rapid improvements in battery technology, compute power and camera systems in the last few years, the most popular techniques for counting fish and measuring their lengths employ humans. In this paper, I present FishSense as an alternative. By utilizing a compact 3-D camera, powerful embedded compute system, and easily-available off-the-shelf parts for assembly, the FishSense modules are sleek, cost-effective and modular systems able to slot into a wide variety of applications. By capturing both depth and color image data, these modules are able to measure the length of individual fish as well, offering an effective non-invasive solution to length \& biomass estimation. The hardware design allows for a high degree of modularity, with options for longer battery life, better performance, and applications in longer-term passive monitoring. The FishSense handheld model has been rigorously tested in several deployments, ranging from a small testing pool with toy fish, to a 70,000 gallon aquarium tank, to an active aquaculture center, with more planned in upcoming months, and preliminary software results from these deployments demonstrate the efficacy of the FishSense modules at measuring fish populations and sizes.},

	abstract     = {Underwater stereo–video systems are widely used for counting and measuring fish in aquaculture, fisheries, and conservation management. Length measurements are generated from stereo–video recordings by a software operator using a mouse to locate the head and tail of a fish in synchronized pairs of images. This data can be used to compare spatial and temporal changes in the mean length and biomass or frequency distributions of populations of fishes. Since the early 1990s stereo–video has also been used for measuring the lengths of fish in aquaculture for quota and farm management. However, the costs of the equipment, software, the time, and salary costs involved in post processing imagery manually and the subsequent delays in the availability of length information inhibit the adoption of this technology.We present a semi-automatic method for capturing stereo–video measurements to estimate the lengths of fish. We compare the time taken to make measurements of the same fish measured manually from stereo–video imagery to that measured semi-automatically. Using imagery recorded during transfers of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) from tow cages to grow out cages, we demonstrate that the semi-automatic algorithm developed can obtain fork length measurements with an error of less than 1\\% of the true length and with at least a sixfold reduction in operator time in comparison to manual measurements. Of the 22 138 SBT recorded we were able to measure 52.6\\% (11 647) manually and 11.8\\% (2614) semi-automatically. For seven of the eight cage transfers recorde,d there were no statistical differences in the mean length, weight, or length frequency between manual and semi-automatic measurements. When the data were pooled across the eight cage transfers, there was no statistical difference in mean length or weight between the stereo–video-based manual and semi-automated measurements. Hence, the presented semi-automatic system can be deployed to significantly reduce the cost involved in adoption of stereo–video technology.},

These traits provide U-net with a very high utility within the medical imaging community and have resulted in extensive adoption of U-net as the primary tool for segmentation tasks in medical imaging. The success of U-net is evident in its widespread use in all major image modalities from CT scans and MRI to X-rays and microscopy. Furthermore, while U-net is largely a segmentation tool, there have been instances of the use of U-net in other applications. As the potential of U-net is still increasing, in this review we look at the various developments that have been made in the U-net architecture and provide observations on recent trends. We examine the various innovations that have been made in deep learning and discuss how these tools facilitate U-net. Furthermore, we look at image modalities and application areas where U-net has been applied.},

	abstract     = {This paper presents HITNet, a novel neural network architecture for real-time stereo matching. Contrary to many recent neural network approaches that operate on a full cost volume and rely on 3D convolutions, our approach does not explicitly build a volume and instead relies on a fast multi-resolution initialization step, differentiable 2D geometric propagation and warping mechanisms to infer disparity hypotheses. To achieve a high level of accuracy, our network not only geometrically reasons about disparities but also infers slanted plane hypotheses allowing to more accurately perform geometric warping and upsampling operations. Our architecture is inherently multi-resolution allowing the propagation of information across different levels. Multiple experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach at a fraction of the computation required by state-of-the-art methods. At the time of writing, HITNet ranks 1st-3rd on all the metrics published on the ETH3D website for two view stereo, ranks 1st on most of the metrics among all the end-to-end learning approaches on Middlebury-v3, ranks 1st on the popular KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks among the published methods faster than 100ms.},

These models, however, suffer from a notable decrease in accuracy when exposed to scenarios significantly different from the training set, e.g., real vs synthetic images, etc.). We argue that it is extremely unlikely to gather enough samples to achieve effective training/tuning in any target domain, thus making this setup impractical for many applications. Instead, we propose to perform unsupervised and continuous online adaptation of a deep stereo network, which allows for preserving its accuracy in any environment. However, this strategy is extremely computationally demanding and thus prevents real-time inference. We address this issue introducing a new lightweight, yet effective, deep stereo architecture, Modularly ADaptive Network (MADNet) and developing a Modular ADaptation (MAD) algorithm, which independently trains sub-portions of the network. By deploying MADNet together with MAD we introduce the first real-time self-adaptive deep stereo system enabling competitive performance on heterogeneous datasets.},

However, existing networks are difficult to use for practical applications since (1) they are memory-hungry and unable to process even modest-size images, (2) they have to be trained for a given disparity range. The Practical Deep Stereo (PDS) network that we propose addresses both issues: First, its architecture relies on novel bottleneck modules that drastically reduce the memory footprint in inference, and additional design choices allow to handle greater image size during training. This results in a model that leverages large image context to resolve matching ambiguities. Second, a novel sub-pixel cross- entropy loss combined with a MAP estimator make this network less sensitive to ambiguous matches, and applicable to any disparity range without re-training. We compare PDS to state-of-the-art methods published over the recent months, and demonstrate its superior performance on FlyingThings3D and KITTI sets.},

Obstacle avoidance and effective path planning require online dense reconstructions of the environment. Autonomous operation is central to environmental monitoring, marine archaeology, resource utilization, and underwater cave exploration. To address this problem, we propose to use SVIn2, a robust VIO method, together with a real-time 3D reconstruction pipeline. We provide extensive evaluation on four challenging underwater datasets.

However, cameras that have been calibrated in air are notably inaccurate in depth measurements when placed underwater, and little research has been done to explore pre-existing depth calibration methodologies and their effectiveness in underwater environments. We used four methods of calibration on a low-cost, commercial depth camera both in and out of water. For each of these methods, we compared the predicted distance and length of objects from the camera with manually measured values to get an indication of depth and length accuracy. Our findings indicate that the standard methods of calibration in air are largely ineffective for underwater calibration and that custom calibration techniques are necessary to achieve higher accuracy.},

Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision one more step from laboratory environments to real world use.},

	abstract     = {Learning-based stereo matching has recently achieved promising results, yet still suffers difficulties in establishing reliable matches in weakly matchable regions that are textureless, non-Lambertian, or occluded. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a stereo matching network that considers pixel-wise matchability. Specifically, the network jointly regresses disparity and matchability maps from 3D probability volume through expectation and entropy operations. Next, a learned attenuation is applied as the robust loss function to alleviate the influence of weakly matchable pixels in the training. Finally, a matchability-aware disparity refinement is introduced to improve the depth inference in weakly matchable regions. The proposed deep stereo matchability (DSM) framework can improve the matching result or accelerate the computation while still guaranteeing the quality. Moreover, the DSM framework is portable to many recent stereo networks. Extensive experiments are conducted on Scene Flow and KITTI stereo datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework over the state-of-the-art learning-based stereo methods.},
