2. Tighten the screw of the lower mount until it remains stable.
3. Place laser in mount and align the line displayed on the top half of the mount with the center of the laser.
4. Screw the top half of the mount to the bottom half of the mount to secure the laser and complete the mount.

## Disassembling Laser Mount

3. Loosen the center screw of the mount until the lower half of the mount can be slid out of [mounting location] to complete disassembly.

## Using the Camera
1. Prior to use, ensure that the camera system has been properly assembled and that the laser mount is secure.
2. Take the camera underwater and begin to flood the camera lens.
3. Turn on laser. Bias the camera laser slightly to the right.
4. When laser is in use, aim it towards the center of body mass of the fish. Ensure that the laser is not being pointed directly towards a person if multiple people are present.

2.  Camera Calibration: Take 50-60 images of the calibration board at varying angles and distances.
3.  Laser Calibration: Take a picture of the laser dot from 0.5 to 6m with 0.1m increments. Use the front edge of chamfer on top of the camera housing as distance reference.
