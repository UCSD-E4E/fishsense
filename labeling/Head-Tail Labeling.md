Thank you for agreeing to label the head and tail images! We truly appreciate your effort in processing data and making future models more efficient.
## Mark Head/Tail
It's important to consider where to label the fish itself. For the head, please label the farthest point possible on the fish's mouth. The tail point should be labeled at the middle point of the caudal fin. This is what we refer to as the fork length. Below is an image that should help clarify what locations we are interested in for head-tail measurement:

As we can see from the lower two diagrams, we are choosing the middle point of the fish's tail. A great way to think of it is what length you'd measure if you placed the fish on a measuring board and wanted the length along the middle section of the fish.

Many of these photos will be really washed out, but we recommend using the contrast between the background (if it's the environment or a fish without the laser) and the fish with the laser to find an edge. Please reach out to Christopher Crutchfield ([email](mailto:ccrutchf@ucsd.edu)) or Nathan Hui ([email](mailto:nthui@ucsd.edu)) if you have any questions about specific fish or photos and we'll make sure to help!
## Labeling Instructions
You should have received an email with a small description on how to get started on labeling. Press on the link to labeler.e4e.ucsd.edu and make an account to get started!

There may be many projects you see, but focus only on the green projects for REEF. Click on the three dots next to the project titled `Fishsense Head/Tail (REEF)` first. A pop-up should come up that says "Label" and "Settings". Press "Label" to get started!

There are a few types of photos you may see, so let's go over all of them!

1. If there is no fish with a laser on it in the image, please press submit at the bottom. This lets us know there is no fish in the image. Please note that you should not be using the 'Skip' button to classify an image as 'No Fish'.
2. If there is a fish in the image with a laser, *but* the fish's head or tail is covered up by the environment, other fish, etc., then it can be tricky. If you're comfortable guessing where the fish's head or tail would end, then follow the labeling instructions after this. If not, then please press 'Skip' so we know to take a closer look at it.
3. Now, if there is a fish in the image with a laser on it, then follow the instructions below:
	1. Zoom into the fish and make sure it's centered in the image pane first. This can be done with your mouse's scroll wheel, or repeatedly pressing "Ctrl" and "+" together to zoom into the fish. Pan the image to center it by pressing "H" before clicking and holding the left mouse button on the image to drag it around.
	2. Press the '1' on your keyboard to label the fish's Snout/Head. Left click on the fish's snout, following the instructions above to find the exact location.
	3. After completing the Snout/Head annotation, press '2' and then left click on the Fish's Fork/Tail to complete that annotation.
	4. If you are happy with the annotation, press submit and continue to the next image! Otherwise, follow the instructions below to modify an image's annotations.

### Modifying Annotations
To modify existing annotations, use the pane below under 'Regions'. Press on the annotation that corresponds to the annotation you wish to delete (If you only see 'Fork' or 'Snout' instead of the labeled annotations, press the carrot icon).

Click on one of the annotations themselves (the entries that are numbered) to select it and press the 'Backspace' button on your keyboard to delete them. Pressing either '1' or '2' after selecting an annotation can change the type from 'Snout' to 'Fork' and vice-versa.
